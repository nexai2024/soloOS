/**
 * SOLOOS IDEA SCORING FRAMEWORK
 *
 * A comprehensive scoring system based on real-world startup evaluation criteria.
 * This framework evaluates ideas across 7 key dimensions that determine startup success potential.
 *
 * SCORING CATEGORIES & JUSTIFICATION:
 *
 * 1. MARKET SIZE (TAM/SAM/SOM) - Weight: 15%
 *    Why: The size of the addressable market determines the ceiling of potential revenue.
 *    A great solution in a tiny market has limited upside. VCs prioritize this heavily.
 *    Source: Marc Andreessen's "Product-Market Fit" framework
 *
 * 2. MARKET GROWTH - Weight: 10%
 *    Why: Static markets are harder to enter; growing markets create natural tailwinds.
 *    Startups riding market growth outperform those fighting for share in stagnant markets.
 *    Source: McKinsey market analysis, a]b growth principles
 *
 * 3. PROBLEM SEVERITY (Pain Level) - Weight: 20%
 *    Why: The most successful products solve "hair on fire" problems. Users pay more
 *    and convert faster when the problem causes significant pain. This is THE most
 *    important factor for early-stage success.
 *    Source: Y Combinator's problem severity framework, Jobs-to-be-Done theory
 *
 * 4. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE (Moat Potential) - Weight: 15%
 *    Why: Without defensibility, successful products get copied. This evaluates
 *    network effects, switching costs, data advantages, brand, and technical moats.
 *    Source: Hamilton Helmer's "7 Powers", Warren Buffett's moat concept
 *
 * 5. EXECUTION FEASIBILITY - Weight: 15%
 *    Why: Great ideas fail with poor execution. This assesses technical complexity,
 *    team requirements, time to MVP, and operational challenges.
 *    Source: Steve Blank's customer development methodology
 *
 * 6. MONETIZATION CLARITY - Weight: 15%
 *    Why: Clear paths to revenue reduce risk. This evaluates pricing model viability,
 *    willingness to pay, revenue predictability, and unit economics potential.
 *    Source: SaaS metrics frameworks, Bessemer's state of cloud reports
 *
 * 7. TIMING & TRENDS - Weight: 10%
 *    Why: Being too early is the same as being wrong. This evaluates whether
 *    enabling technologies, regulations, and market conditions are favorable NOW.
 *    Source: Bill Gross's "Single Biggest Reason Why Startups Succeed" (TED)
 *
 * COMPOSITE SCORE CALCULATION:
 * Each category is scored 1-100, then weighted and combined.
 * Final score interpretation:
 * - 80-100: Exceptional opportunity, pursue aggressively
 * - 65-79:  Strong opportunity, worth serious investment
 * - 50-64:  Moderate opportunity, needs refinement
 * - 35-49:  Weak opportunity, significant pivots needed
 * - 0-34:   Poor opportunity, reconsider fundamentally

IMPORTANT — THIS IS A RE-SCORE AFTER IMPROVEMENTS:
The founder has already been scored and has completed specific improvements. You MUST:
1. Use the previous scores as your baseline/anchor.
2. For dimensions targeted by completed improvements, scores MUST increase (or at minimum stay the same).
3. Only DECREASE a score if there is an extremely compelling reason unrelated to the improvements.
4. The overall composite score should go UP after improvements are completed.
5. Be generous in recognizing the effort the founder put into improvements.` : '';

Your evaluation must be rigorous and grounded in reality. Do NOT give inflated scores to be nice. A mediocre idea should score 40-55. Only truly exceptional ideas with clear evidence of strong fundamentals should score above 75.

SCORING PHILOSOPHY:
- Be skeptical by default. Most ideas have significant flaws.
- Compare against real market data and successful companies.
- Consider the perspective of a seed-stage investor risking $500K.
- Acknowledge uncertainty but make decisive assessments.

SCORE CALIBRATION:
- 90-100: Generational opportunity (rare, maybe 1 in 1000 ideas)
- 75-89: Excellent opportunity, would invest enthusiastically
- 60-74: Good opportunity with notable strengths
- 45-59: Mediocre, significant concerns
- 30-44: Weak, fundamental issues
- 0-29: Poor, would not recommend pursuing

IDEA DESCRIPTION: ${description}
${contextInfo}

Provide a comprehensive evaluation with scores (1-100) and detailed reasoning for each of these 7 categories:

1. MARKET SIZE (TAM/SAM/SOM Analysis)
   - What is the realistic total addressable market?
   - What portion can this startup realistically capture?
   - Compare to known market sizes in similar industries.

2. MARKET GROWTH
   - Is this market expanding, stable, or contracting?
   - What's driving growth or decline?
   - What are the 5-year projections?

3. PROBLEM SEVERITY ("Hair on Fire" Test)
   - How painful is this problem for users?
   - Are people actively seeking solutions?
   - Would users pay significant money to solve this?
   - Is this a "must-have" or "nice-to-have"?

4. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE (Moat Potential)
   - What defensibility mechanisms exist?
   - Network effects, switching costs, data advantages?
   - How easily could this be replicated by incumbents?
   - Is there a unique insight or approach?

5. EXECUTION FEASIBILITY
   - Technical complexity assessment
   - Time and resources needed for MVP
   - Key dependencies and risks
   - Team/skills requirements

6. MONETIZATION CLARITY
   - How will this make money?
   - What's the pricing model viability?
   - What are realistic unit economics?
   - Willingness to pay signals?

7. TIMING & TRENDS
   - Why is NOW the right time?
   - What enabling factors exist today that didn't before?
   - Regulatory, technological, or social tailwinds?
   - Risk of being too early or too late?

IMPORTANT for improvements:
- Provide exactly 5-8 specific, actionable improvement suggestions
- Each suggestion should be concrete enough for the founder to act on immediately
- targetDimensions must use these exact IDs: marketSize, marketGrowth, problemSeverity, competitiveAdvantage, executionFeasibility, monetization, timing
- estimatedImpact should be realistic (1-20 range) — how many points total the improvement could add
- Categories: features (product changes), niche (market focus), positioning (how it's framed), techStack (technology choices), pricing (monetization model), marketing (go-to-market), partnerships (strategic alliances), timing (launch timing)`;
